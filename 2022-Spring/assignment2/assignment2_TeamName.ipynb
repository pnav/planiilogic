    "In Assignment 1, you created a looping solution to calculate the *n*th number in the *Wettlaufer* series (a Fibonacci-like sequence with genotype (1,11)). Thus, the phenotype of the Wettlaufer series is `1 11 12 23 35 ...`.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, you will create a recursive solution to compute the *n*th Wettlaufer number. Notice how this solution differs from the looping solution from Assignment 1. The testing notebook cell uses the Python `time` package to measure the duration of each Wettlaufer calcuation. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Ponderable:* Notice how the calculation duration changes dramatically as the value of *n* increases? Why?\n",
    "\n",
    "The recursive solution is elegant but inefficient, particularly for large values of *n*. To reduce the calculation time, you will implement a new function `cached_wettlaufer` that stores the intermediate results of Wettlaufer calculations in a global dictionary. This cache trades a small amount of extra memory and bookkeeping for a large improvement in runtime efficiency. Notice the duration difference between the cached version and the uncached version.\n",

    "Here is your first \"real\" coding assignment! Based on your experience in this class, the New York Times has hired you as a summer intern (!) to help develop new editions of their [Spelling Bee](https://www.nytimes.com/puzzles/spelling-bee) puzzle. Here are the rules to Spelling Bee:\n",
    "\n",
    "* How to Play Spelling Bee - Create words using letters from the \"hive\"!\n",
    "    - Words must contain at least 4 letters.\n",
    "    - Words must include the 'center' letter. \n",
    "    - Letters of the 'beehive' can be used more than once.\n",
    "\n",
    "* How words are scored:\n",
    "    - Words shorter than 4 letters are 0 points.\n",
    "    - Words that use letters not in the 'beehive' are 0 points.\n",
    "    - Words that do not use the 'center' letter are 0 points.\n",
    "    - Valid 4-letter words are worth 1 point each.\n",
    "    - Valid words longer than 4 letters earn 1 point per letter.\n",
    "    - A word that uses all 7 letters of the beehive earns 7 bonus points (a 'pangram').\n",
    "\n",
    "The puzzle editors will give you a word list (in this case, over 200,000 words from a subset of Webster's Second International dictionary) and ask you to generate some puzzle candidates and their scoring statistics. To do this, you will need to determine several things: how to obtain the word list; how to score a word for a given puzzle configuration (i.e., the 'beehive' letter set and center letter); how to extract candidate puzzle anchor words ('pangram' words) that define the 'beehive' set for a puzzle; and how to rate the quality of a candidate 'beehive' set by determining the highest score and its word count for each possible center letter of the beehive set. n.b.: the highest score might not have the highest word count (but usually does), so return the count associated with the high score, don't consider the count separately. You will also create a function to calculate a random sample of a given word list in order to create unbiased test sets more efficiently.\n",

    "- Complete the definition of `get_words` so that proper nouns (i.e., capitalized words) are excluded from the returned word list if the argument `remove_proper` is `True`.\n",
    "- Complete the definition of `score_word` so that it returns the score for a given word using a given beehive letter-set and center letter.\n",
    "- Complete the definition of `candidate_words` so that it returns a list of all words from a given word list that meet the necessary criterion for a 'beehive' set, namely that the word uses exactly 7 letters (repeated letters are okay).\n",
    "- Complete the definition of `sample_words` so that for a given word list, it returns a sublist with length that is approximately the given percentage of the given list. Build the sublist by randomly sampling the given list. Due to this random sampling, the words in your sublist will likely change each time you call sample_words, and depending on your implementation, the exact number of words can also change. This is okay so long as the requested percentage of the list is returned _on average_.\n",
    "- Complete the definition of `score_candidate` so that for a given candidate word and word list, it returns the score and found word count for each possible center letter of the 'beehive' for the given candidate word. Your solution should use the functions you implemented in the previous steps.\n",
