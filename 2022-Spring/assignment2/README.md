# Assignment 2 notes

## Statement on the dictionary used in the assignment

The word list found here is an abridged version of the Webster's Second 
International dictionary (Copyright 1934) that is included in certain 
copies of FreeBSD, including the MacOS operating system 
(see `/usr/share/dict/web2`). By its nature, a dictionary can contain 
words that may be offensive to certain people or groups, and this 
dictionary is no different. This is doubly true for old dictionaries 
that reflect terms in use at the time of publishing and do not reflect 
modern norms. Such dictionaries can be free to use if the copyright
on their compilation has expired (as with this dictionary), and as 
such can be useful pedagogical tools.

While it can be useful to consider the full text of an old dictionary
in certain pedagogical contexts, such as the study of language 
evolution, this assignment is not such a context. Therefore, I have 
made a good-faith effort to remove offensive terms from the word list 
used in this assignment. If you find any offensive terms remain, 
please open an issue in this repository or otherwise let me know.
