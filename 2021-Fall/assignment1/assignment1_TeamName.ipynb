    "In GEB Chapter 1, Hofstadter presents **MIU** strings and rules to operate on them. For a given **MIU** string *miu_str*, write a logical statement for each **MIU** rule that evaluates to *True* if the **MIU** rule can be applied to the string and to *False* otherwise. If the logical statement evaluates to *True*, print that the **MIU** rule can be applied and its result; if *False* print that the **MIU** rule cannot be applied. \n",
