    "## Question 1\n",
    "In *SN*, Silver presents an argument for Bayesian-based models to handle uncertainty. Are you convinced? Are there examples of Bayesian models in your discipline, or if not, can you conceive how one might be developed? If you are pro-Bayesian, describe how such models (real or hypothetical) would operate. If you are anti-Bayesian, describe what about your discipline prevents the development of usable probabilities and priors, and what other predictive measures you might employ.\n",

    "In *SN*, Silver uses Texas Hold-em Poker to demonstrate notions of prior and posterior probabilities. In the subquestions below, you will work through examples using the card game Blackjack (also known as 21). Aces can be scored as 1 or 11, all face cards (Jack, Queen, King) are scored 10, all other cards are scored according to their rank (2 to 10). Suits are ignored. The goal is to get as close to 21 without going over (going \"bust\"). A two-card 21 (Ace plus a face card or ten) is a \"blackjack\"."

There are four other players at the table showing the following cards: Ace-4; King-6; 7-9; 8-Jack. The dealer shows a 3 (you cannot see their other card). You have first action at the table.

You remember that in addition to the Queen above, seven other face cards have been played, as well as two 10s and two 7s and the 9 and 8 from your first hand. The next deal comes from the remaining 22 cards. The dealer is again showing a Queen and again does not have blackjack. You again have a 9-8 for 17.
